# PigSpawnerFinder
Finds pig spawners in a seed

A badly written fork of Neil's code https://github.com/hube12/PigSpawnerFinder, which is based on the code by Andrew https://github.com/Gaider10/PigSpawnerFinder

If you want an up-to-date pig spawner finder, I recommend using Neil's. This particular fork is just adapted for the needs of the Melontech server, and I don't promise to maintain it.
